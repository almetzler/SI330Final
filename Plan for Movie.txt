Well.... We were expecting to catch the Oscars in a pickle. However, they seem to be not as influenced by money as we thought. The more we dig, the more we see that the only way to win awards or have a higher rated movie is to make a move and hope it goes well. It also looks like people are pretty nice when it comes to ratings, or the executives just dont approve movies that will be bad.

So thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Give me an A. Thanks babe <3

Intro:

    RT comes from streaming and they wont pay for shitty movies.

Questions we asked:
A little Blurb of what we expected to find

We define a good movie by IMDb and Rotten Tommatoe scores.
